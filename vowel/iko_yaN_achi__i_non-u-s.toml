# The below specifies a regular expression pattern. If you teach yourself some basics of regular expressions, you can contribute such rules. 
# The below tells the following in a machine-understandable way: Look for patterns where a non udAtta or svarita इ or ई (possibly annotated by anunAsika and other markers) is followed by अच् (also possibly annotated by anunAsika, accent and other markers).
input_pattern = "([इई])(ँ?)([^\꣡\꣢᳡]?)([OTHER_MARKERS.ALL]*)([PRATYAHARA.ACH])(ँ?)([ACCENTS]?)([OTHER_MARKERS.ALL]*)"
# Note that the pattern above defines: 4 groups for the first vowel, 4 for the second. We've added \ for readability - that might need to be removed prior to use in some programming languages.
# ACCENTS, OTHER_MARKERS.ALL and PRATYAHARA.ACH are defined in /terms.toml. They should be substituted in order to get valid regular expression substitution rules.

# The below is an array of substitution rules. For some other euphonic combination, it could have multiple [[substitutions]] elements to account for multiple optional forms resulting from a single rule seqnece. Each substition element has a regex pattern and a rule sequence.

# The below too specifies a regular expression substitution.
# The below tells the following in a machine-understandable way: If a string of letters matching input_pattern defined above is found: 
# - first define paranthesized groups such as $1 representing ([इई]), $2 representing a possible anunAsika sign, etc..
# - then, replace the matched string with य्followed by the groups of letters defined above. It is assumed that the anunAsika sequence

# The index list above is critical (unlike the text_list and examples list below, which merely serve to make this file more readable). It should correspond to the rule number used in the central aShTAdhyAyI repository at https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/ , so that sandhi engines can read and present details of these rules from that repository to the user. Append to the sUtra number some text like "_v1" for vArtika numbe 1 or "_b1" for the first bhAShya shloka.
